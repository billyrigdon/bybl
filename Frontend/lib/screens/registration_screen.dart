- We never sell personal data. Period.
- Under 13? Please do not use Bybl without verified parental consent (COPPA).
- You control your content and can export or delete it at any time.

This “Quick-Read” is for convenience only. The legally binding document is the full text below.

1. Who We Are

bybl ("App") is an open-source Bible study application maintained by [well-edumacated] ("Company," "we," "our"). Our codebase is available publicly.
Contact: billy@bybl.dev

2. Scope

This combined Privacy Policy ("Policy") and Terms of Service ("Terms") governs your access to and use of the App, our APIs, and any related services (collectively, "Services"). By installing or using the Services you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

3. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:
- Account Data: such as email, display name, hashed password, and profile image, to create and manage your account.
- User Content: including saved verses, notes, posts, and messages, to provide core functionality.
- Usage and Device Data: like log files, device model, OS version, and IP address, for debugging, abuse prevention, and analytics.
- Crash and Performance Data: such as stack traces via Sentry and performance metrics via New Relic, for stability and performance.
- Third-Party Content: Bible text via API.Bible and AI prompts via the OpenAI API, to deliver features.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (e.g., race, religion, health). Any such data appears only if you choose to include it.

4. How We Use Your Information

1. Provide the Services you request (e.g., display scripture, generate AI study aids).
2. Operate, maintain, and improve the App, fix bugs, and analyze performance.
3. Communicate with you about updates, security alerts, and support.
4. Protect the App, our users, and the public (fraud prevention, abuse detection).
5. Comply with legal requirements (e.g., court orders, lawful requests).

5. Legal Bases (GDPR / CCPA / etc.)

- Contract: Providing the Services you request.
- Legitimate Interest: Analytics, security, fraud prevention.
- Consent: Optional features such as marketing emails.
- Legal Obligation: Compliance with applicable laws.

6. Children’s Privacy (COPPA)

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data, contact us at billy@bybl.dev and we will delete it. Children may use Bybl only with verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA.

7. Third-Party Services

We use the following services:
- Sentry: for error and crash reporting (e.g., stack traces, device info).
- New Relic: for performance monitoring (e.g., aggregated metrics).
- Firebase (optional): for push notifications and analytics (e.g., device tokens, event data).
- OpenAI API: for AI summaries and chat (e.g., user prompts, selected verses).
- API.Bible: for scripture text (e.g., anonymous metadata).
- Wasabi S3: for media storage (e.g., uploaded images, backups).

Each service has its own privacy policy. We only share the minimum data needed and have data-processing agreements where applicable.

8. How We Store & Protect Data

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) for PostgreSQL and S3.
- Least-privilege access controls and audited server logins.
- Regular security updates including OS patches, dependency scanning, and container hardening.
- Backups are encrypted and stored separately.

No system is 100% secure; use of the Services is at your own risk.

9. Your Rights & Choices

- Access / Portability: You can download a copy of your data.
- Correction: You can update inaccurate information.
- Deletion: You can delete your account and data.
- Opt-Out: You can disable analytics and crash reporting in Settings.

10. International Transfers

We are based in the United States. If you access the Services from outside the US, you consent to transferring your data to the US and other countries where our providers operate.

11. Data Retention

We keep your data only as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legal or business purposes. Crash logs older than 90 days are automatically deleted unless needed for debugging.
